# CNARSP
An Open-Source Tool for the Classification of Narratives in Survey Data Using Pre-Trained Language Models

Background

Under a grant from the National Science Foundation Award FW-HTF-P 2128416, this tool was developed to classify occupation types depicted in narrative responses in longitudinal survey data. 
Although the implementation of existing machine learning methods provided us with valuable insights into occupation type distributions and changes over time, the prediction models also produced ambiguous results for a substantial number of instances, which had to be manually labeled by human coders. 
To improve our prediction models, we use BERT in our new project.
This project produces a code file with a file extension ‘.ipynb’ (CNARSP_v1.ipynb). 
The code is written in a scripting language (‘python’ version 3.6.5 or above) using open-source machine learning (‘scikit-learn’) and Natural Language Processing (‘Transformers’) packages and the pre-trained language model BERT (BERT-base). The code set is named ‘CNARS/P’ (Classification of Narratives in Survey Data with Pre-trained language models).

For details about the code and step-by-step guide for implementation, see the report "C-NARS/P: An Open-Source Tool for Classification of Narratives in Survey Data Using Pre-Trained Language Models" at https://dx.doi.org/10.7302/8676 or https://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/178287
